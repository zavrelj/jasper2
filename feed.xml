&lt;p&gt;Hitting the wall means getting to the phase when you’re no longer interested in your project, the initial excitement is far gone and all that’s left is the mundane grinding. This is the time when most projects get canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are aware of this phenomenon usually opt for short-term projects so they don’t get to that phase and they try to finish them before the initial excitement get burned out. The risk of this approach lies in the subpar quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, you can’t usually deliver anything substantial in a very short time. You can’t write the book in a day, you can’t record quality online course in a week, you can’t create an amazing mobile game in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good things just take time to make. The more time you spend on the same project the more probably you are going to hit the wall, but it doesn’t mean that you should abandon long and time-consuming work. It means that you need to understand how to get over the wall and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started producing online content, it was an amazingly painful process, because I was hitting the wall most of the time. I got easily excited, but after few weeks, I just openly hated the whole idea and wanted to drop it. Somehow, I managed to keep going and eventually, the fire got ignited again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really helps if you just show up. Make your project into a ritual. Don’t think about your emotions when it’s time to sit down and work. Just treat it as something you need to do no matter what. Most of the time, showing up is all it takes. Make an appointment with your project. I mean, really, write it on your calendar, so you can treat it like a meeting. Make a coffee or tea, get ready and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you might be able to squeeze only 5 minutes, but even 5 minutes is better than nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, make sure to praise yourself for what you have done. It’s very important to constantly remind yourself that you are making progress, even if it’s very small progress, it will compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jan Zavrel</name></author><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html">I strongly believe that the most important skill that makes the difference between the success and the failure is the ability to overcome the phase which will inevitably occur most of the time, especially on long-term projects, hitting the wall.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why the Concept of Evernote Notebooks Is Flawed</title><link href="/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why the Concept of Evernote Notebooks Is Flawed" /><published>2018-04-14T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-14T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed</id><content type="html" xml:base="/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed">&lt;p&gt;Evernote is an amazing service. I can’t imagine managing all my task and projects without it. I use Evernote regularly for some six years and since I sorted out my methodology and published it as a book and an online course, I can’t fathom how Evernote itself can’t grasp how flawed the concept of notebooks really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernote hides inside its service one of the best implementation of tags available&lt;/strong&gt;, but somehow they haven’t recognized it yet and heavily promote the use of notebooks instead which is beyond my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Evernote Certified Consultant I pointed out many times during my exam and even within the community of fellow consultants, that &lt;strong&gt;Evernote should really focus on promoting tags instead of notebooks&lt;/strong&gt; because tags offer more versatility compared to somewhat rigid notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evernote-limits&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernote limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, notebooks are heavily limited in numbers. Compared to 100.000 tags, you can create only personal 250 notebooks which is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed-img01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Evernote limits&quot; title=&quot;Evernote limits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;excluding-usage&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excluding usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;notebooks shouldn’t be used as a project storage&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only you are heavily limited, as I mentioned above, but more importantly, you can’t have the same note save in two or more notebooks at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many years of using Evernote as a project management tool, it happen to me many times that I had to assign one note two three or even more projects, because sometimes, people just tend to send you overviews by emails and they don’t want to send the current progress of each project in separate email. No, they just send it in one email. Now, when you want to store this email in notebooks, which one will you choose? The most important project? The most recent project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you see how flawed this is. Yet Evernote still suggests that you use notebooks this way while completely ignoring their gold nugget, tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tags, you don’t have to think about this too long. You can assign 100 tags per note. So if your that overview email mentions 5 projects, you can simply assign 5 tags to this note and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proper-naming-convention&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper naming convention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I suggest that we should switch from notebooks to tags, the most frequent argument is that with tags, everything would turn into a mess after some time. Yes, if the limit of 250 notebooks makes your Evernote less messy because you can’t simply create more notebooks, that’s fine. With 100.000 tags, you must get into a very messy situation, right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it takes is a little bit of thinking and a little bit of discipline. With the right naming convention you can keep your list of tags organized even with almost a thousand of them, like in my case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed-img02.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keeping tags organized&quot; title=&quot;Keeping tags organized&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the image above, I have just six notebooks, everything else is managed by tags. Also, I have already almost 6.000 notes in my personal account and yet I am able to find anything almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I need to find that contract signed with that company. Hmm, let’s see. I can easily start searching among all my notes and with just two tags, I’m done: &lt;strong&gt;d.contract&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;k.AUTOCONT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed-img03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search for anything, super fast!&quot; title=&quot;Search for anything, super fast!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tags representing &lt;em&gt;document type&lt;/em&gt; start with the &lt;strong&gt;d.&lt;/strong&gt; prefix. You can have d.contract, d.email_sent, d.email_received, d.offer, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tags representing &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;companies&lt;/em&gt; start with the &lt;strong&gt;k.&lt;/strong&gt; prefix. You can have k.Smith_John, k.MICROSOFT and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you search for notes with tags assigned, you don’t have to think about the name of the tag, all you need is to know, that there should always be some &lt;em&gt;document type&lt;/em&gt;, some &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; and ideally even some _project_assigned to the note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you guessed it. All tags representing project start with the &lt;strong&gt;p.&lt;/strong&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-tasks-withevernote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing tasks with Evernote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make it really simple. You should be able to keep track of the progress of your tasks because buying a milk won’t always cut it. Some of the tasks I keep the track of takes more than a year to finish, so without a proper system, I would be completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you can use Evernote as a task manager. Compared to any other alternative, the tags are again the main reason why you shouldn’t consider anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task are basically notes with a reminder and due date assigned. This way, you can easily sort all your tasks by due date. Active tasks belong to &lt;strong&gt;t.active&lt;/strong&gt;notebook, idle tasks belong to &lt;strong&gt;t.idle&lt;/strong&gt; notebook and completed tasks, well, to &lt;strong&gt;t.completed&lt;/strong&gt; notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the so-called &lt;em&gt;Arrow Notation&lt;/em&gt;, you can keep track of everything that happens with the particular tasks. &lt;strong&gt;Smith_John -&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; means that Smith gave you some information or asked you to do something while &lt;strong&gt;-&amp;gt; Smith_John&lt;/strong&gt;means that you gave Smith some information or delegated some job to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you bump into somebody at work and by searching for &lt;strong&gt;-&amp;gt; Peter&lt;/strong&gt; you get immediately everything you need to discuss with this poor guy. That’s what I call power and that’s how I am able to manage all of my 129 currently active projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-not-a-coincidence-its-asystem&quot;&gt;It’s not a coincidence, it’s a system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is just a quick sneak peek of the methodology I have invented during my almost 10 years of using Evernote. I call it THE SYSTEM2, because all you need is two types of notebooks, two types of notes and two types of tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SYSTEM2 is a book and an online course. It’s based on GTD, but takes it to the next level. It’s Evernote on steroids and it’s available for free of charge for anyone who wants to get the most out of Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;links-youbet&quot;&gt;Links? You bet!&lt;/h3&gt;

I use it to track my personal tasks, my online business projects and even my daily job projects. I can’t even imagine how I could manage all my activities without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I wanted to make some money by writing a book about THE SYSTEM2 and also by recording an online course, but yesterday I decided that I wanted everyone who’s interested in getting more productive to have both of these products for free. So from now on, you’ll be able to get my course and the book about THE SYSTEM2 without spending a penny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-thesystem2&quot;&gt;What Is THE SYSTEM2?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SYSTEM2 is the name of the methodology for using Evernote. I invented this methodology by combining different approaches, mainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; (GTD) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesecretweapon.org/&quot;&gt;The Secret Weapon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate using multiple tools. I like things simple. That’s why I’ve always wanted one place for everything and Evernote gave me this except for the proper task management. The power of Evernote, though, is in its freedom of use, so I invented my own way to use it as a task manager and document storage at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-types-ofnotes&quot;&gt;Two types of notes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplicity and power. THE SYSTEM2 brings both at the same time. You will work with just two types of notes. Reference notes and task notes. That’s all you’ll ever need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-types-of-notebooks&quot;&gt;Two types of notebooks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notebook isn’t the ideal tool for organizing stuff. That’s why you need to limit the number of notebooks to the minimum. You will work with just two types of notebooks. One for storing reference notes and one for storing task notes. Yes, it’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-type-oftags&quot;&gt;Two type of tags&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tags are the real power behind THE SYSTEM2. You will use two types of tags. Reference tags and task tags with Arrow Notation to further optimize your workflow. This tagging system will help you find anything, super fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-types-ofroles&quot;&gt;Two types of roles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truly powerful productivity system needs to work as a task manager and a storage for reference materials at the same time. With THE SYSTEM2, you’ll get exactly this, because it combines the two roles efficiently and flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-you-use-thesystem2&quot;&gt;Why Should You Use THE SYSTEM2?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy. If you want to be productive, if you want to do more in less time, or simply if you want to be able to keep track of every single task or project you need to work on or manage, I believe you will hardly find anything better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this statement is pretty bold. But I have yet to find something that will make me leave THE SYSTEM2. I am constantly searching for more optimization, so if there’s better product or methodology, I will happily use it instead of THE SYSTEM2, but there is not or I don’t know about it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-you-believeme&quot;&gt;Why Should You Believe Me?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two reason. First, I’ve been using this system for many years. I know it in and out and since I invented it, I can help you with your first steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I kind of know Evernote, because I am one of Evernote Certified Consultants, so there’s some credit backed by Evernote itself.&lt;/p&gt;

How it all started and what I plan to do with it next. Well, I’ve realized I wouldn’t reload Talker in a way described in that article. Instead, I will teach how to create Talker from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meet-my-newcourse&quot;&gt;Meet my new course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a new course focused on full-stack web development. A few months ago I finished the script which has over 127.000 words and now I’m in the middle of the production of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is aimed for total beginners who have no previous experience with web development. My goal is to teach them everything they need to know so they can start working on their own web applications once they finish this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course, I’ll explain both the front-end and back-end technologies. I will cover HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but also PHP and MySQL. I will discuss different development environments like Docker, Vagrant or XAMPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once students acquire the basic knowledge of these technologies, we will move together to the fun part. We will start building Talker from scratch. Step by step, we will create a database-driven web application with the logic coded in PHP. We will use Bootstrap to make the whole application mobile-ready and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-a-sneakpeek&quot;&gt;Take a sneak peek&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, here are some images of what you can expect. I hope you’ll join me as a student once the course is ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how about you, but I don’t really need 10MB photos of some reference materials. There are a lot of third-party apps and online services for shrinking photos or images to some meaningful (sane) size, but if you’re using Mac, you can just select all the images you need to shrink and use one simple shortcut, like &lt;strong&gt;⇧ ⌘&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; to do the job for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you need to set this up first, because it’s not a built-in feature, and in this article, I will show you how!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meet-automator&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Automator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automator is a great app. You can find it on any Mac with Mac OS X v10.4 (Tiger) or newer. It’s very powerful, and it’s pretty sad that most Mac users don’t even know about its existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire up the Spotlight with the &lt;strong&gt;⌘ SPACE&lt;/strong&gt; combo and type &lt;strong&gt;automator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it appears, just hit &lt;strong&gt;ENTER&lt;/strong&gt; to run it. You should be greeted with similar window as seen below. If not, just select &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;New&lt;/strong&gt; (or hit &lt;strong&gt;⌘ N&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-newservice&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a New Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do a lot with Automator, but let’s not get too excited here. We just need to create a new Service to move on, so select &lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; instead of default &lt;strong&gt;Workflow&lt;/strong&gt; and hit the &lt;strong&gt;Choose&lt;/strong&gt; button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img03.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll get this empty window and the fun can begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img04.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make sure to select the &lt;strong&gt;Image files&lt;/strong&gt; option from the top row, so it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img05.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, go to &lt;strong&gt;Files &amp;amp; Folders&lt;/strong&gt; in the left pane and double-click the &lt;strong&gt;Copy Finder Items&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img06.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow you to keep the original images for whatever reason and place the resized versions in a specific folder. I suggest you create a new folder in &lt;strong&gt;Documents&lt;/strong&gt; and name it &lt;strong&gt;resized_720p&lt;/strong&gt; for example. Next, you will simply select this folder instead of the default &lt;strong&gt;Desktop&lt;/strong&gt; option in the drop-down menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img07.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, double-click the &lt;strong&gt;Rename Finder Items&lt;/strong&gt; option and select &lt;strong&gt;Add Text&lt;/strong&gt; from the drop-down menu. Type the &lt;strong&gt;_720p&lt;/strong&gt; postfix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img08.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, go to &lt;strong&gt;Photos&lt;/strong&gt; and double-click the &lt;strong&gt;Scale Images&lt;/strong&gt; option. When asked, click the &lt;strong&gt;Don’t Add&lt;/strong&gt; button:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img09.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;strong&gt;1280&lt;/strong&gt; as the new size, so you’ll get most of the time the resolution of 1280x720 pixels, also known as 720p, hence the name of the folder :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your settings look like this now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the changes with &lt;strong&gt;⌘ S&lt;/strong&gt; combo and name this service &lt;strong&gt;resize_720p&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img11.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the file is saved, you can quit Automator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-testthis&quot;&gt;Let’s test this!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-click the image of your choice and select &lt;strong&gt;resize_720p&lt;/strong&gt; from the list of services. Resized copy of the image should appear in the &lt;strong&gt;resized_720p&lt;/strong&gt; folder. And by the way, this works even with multiple images selected!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;like-apro&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Pro!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is already pretty good, but let’s take it a step further by creating a shortcut to run this service so you don’t have to select it from the drop-down menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;System Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;, select &lt;strong&gt;Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt; and locate your &lt;strong&gt;resize_720p&lt;/strong&gt; service in the list of &lt;strong&gt;Services:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img13.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Add Shortcut&lt;/strong&gt; button and type the shortcut, make sure it’s not taken by any other application. I chose &lt;strong&gt;⇧&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;⌘&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; (S for “size” to remember it easily) and should work for you as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/resize-images-on-mac-img14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to your images. Select as many as you like and use this shortcut to let the magic happen! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

Every single minute, you have an opportunity to change your life. Sixty times per minute, you have a chance to get up and do something meaningful. How much longer do you plan to waste your time? If you think that tomorrow is fine, you’re wrong. There’s no tomorrow. When tomorrow comes, it will be another today, and you’ll have another 24 hours wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of compounding. It’s quite a remarkable phenomenon in finance. Einstein once called it the most important invention in all of human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing and frightening at the same time because it works regardless of your will. Either you accept it and thrive or deny it and decay. It can shoot you right up among the stars or get you down to your knees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most confusing part about it? It is slow, very slow. You can’t see any immediate results. But you can’t avoid it no matter how hard you try. It is here, constantly, working for you or against you, every single minute every single second. Tick, tick, tick. &lt;br /&gt;
 A year ago, I was a different person. I wasn’t aware of the real power of compounding. Yes, I knew how it worked in finance, but I didn’t realize it was everywhere, slowly killing me in every aspect of my life where I didn’t make it work for me. I wasted my time with needless toys, futile fears, senseless activities. I was weak, and life was pushing me somewhere, but I had no idea where nor why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then something clicked, and I got furious. I imagined myself in a few years as yet another regular forty years old daddy with the beer belly, favorite junk food, calm and obedient sitting in front of TV watching something stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up and decided that I wouldn’t end up like this. I decided that I wouldn’t give a shit anymore about what happened to me, what circumstances brought me to my situation, what others thought I could or couldn’t do. I decided that I would change myself, completely. &lt;br /&gt;
 Tick, tick, tick. A year passed and what a ride it was! The best part is that I have just started, I’ve merely scratched the surface! You see, all those minutes I spent doing something meaningful painted a picture. I realized what the power of compounding could do and boy, was it a masterpiece!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need more money, or time, all you need to take the full advantage of the compounding effect is already in your possession. All it takes is a will to start and grit to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle? The only difference between success and failure? That easy thing, that one step you need to take every single day. It’s so easy to move one step ahead, but it’s also easy not to move. One day, you say, doesn’t make a difference. Wrong! It makes all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did I do? What is the secret? Nothing special, nothing magical. I stopped killing my body with junk food and started preparing food myself, every day, no exception. No matter what, I eat a big bowl of vegetable three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started hitting the gym three times a week and actually working out instead of being there just for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped killing my mind by watching TV and started reading non-fictional books written by inspiring and successful people. I stopped listening to music and radio and started listening to audiobooks whenever I can, mainly while commuting to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped spending money on toys I don’t need and started buying stocks and bonds so the money can work for me instead of working for the vendor of those toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started creating digital products which I can sell to an infinite number of customers. I wrote two books and published dozens of online courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it hard? No! The most difficult part was to get up and do that little step, every single day. &lt;br /&gt;
 Nothing changed on the first day. Not even after the first week. But slowly, after few months, I started to feel something. It all began to fit together, playing nicely in rhyme. After half a year I was already hooked and saw the changes vividly. I was happier, energized, bursting with new ideas, hungry for new knowledge. But most of all, I couldn’t wait to wake up to a brand new day every morning because I realized that I’m on the long-life mission to make myself a better person that I was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m ecstatic. I know I can do anything I want and all it takes is one step, each day, just one simple step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tick, tick, tick. I want you to try it for yourself. Start slowly, do something meaningful for your body and your mind every single day. Let the compounding effect kick in and no matter what, just keep going. Then, after few months, you’ll realize that Einstein was right and you won’t even recognize that person that will be staring back at you from the mirror!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you good luck, strong will, and unshakeable persistence!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jan Zavrel</name></author><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html">Tick, tick, tick.
