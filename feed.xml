&lt;p&gt;Hitting the wall means getting to the phase when you’re no longer interested in your project, the initial excitement is far gone and all that’s left is the mundane grinding. This is the time when most projects get canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are aware of this phenomenon usually opt for short-term projects so they don’t get to that phase and they try to finish them before the initial excitement get burned out. The risk of this approach lies in the subpar quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, you can’t usually deliver anything substantial in a very short time. You can’t write the book in a day, you can’t record quality online course in a week, you can’t create an amazing mobile game in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good things just take time to make. The more time you spend on the same project the more probably you are going to hit the wall, but it doesn’t mean that you should abandon long and time-consuming work. It means that you need to understand how to get over the wall and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started producing online content, it was an amazingly painful process, because I was hitting the wall most of the time. I got easily excited, but after few weeks, I just openly hated the whole idea and wanted to drop it. Somehow, I managed to keep going and eventually, the fire got ignited again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really helps if you just show up. Make your project into a ritual. Don’t think about your emotions when it’s time to sit down and work. Just treat it as something you need to do no matter what. Most of the time, showing up is all it takes. Make an appointment with your project. I mean, really, write it on your calendar, so you can treat it like a meeting. Make a coffee or tea, get ready and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you might be able to squeeze only 5 minutes, but even 5 minutes is better than nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, make sure to praise yourself for what you have done. It’s very important to constantly remind yourself that you are making progress, even if it’s very small progress, it will compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jan Zavrel</name></author><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html">I strongly believe that the most important skill that makes the difference between the success and the failure is the ability to overcome the phase which will inevitably occur most of the time, especially on long-term projects, hitting the wall.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why the Concept of Evernote Notebooks Is Flawed</title><link href="/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why the Concept of Evernote Notebooks Is Flawed" /><published>2018-04-14T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-14T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed</id><content type="html" xml:base="/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed">&lt;p&gt;Evernote is an amazing service. I can’t imagine managing all my task and projects without it. I use Evernote regularly for some six years and since I sorted out my methodology and published it as a book and an online course, I can’t fathom how Evernote itself can’t grasp how flawed the concept of notebooks really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernote hides inside its service one of the best implementation of tags available&lt;/strong&gt;, but somehow they haven’t recognized it yet and heavily promote the use of notebooks instead which is beyond my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Evernote Certified Consultant I pointed out many times during my exam and even within the community of fellow consultants, that &lt;strong&gt;Evernote should really focus on promoting tags instead of notebooks&lt;/strong&gt; because tags offer more versatility compared to somewhat rigid notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evernote-limits&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernote limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, notebooks are heavily limited in numbers. Compared to 100.000 tags, you can create only personal 250 notebooks which is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed-img01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Evernote limits&quot; title=&quot;Evernote limits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;excluding-usage&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excluding usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;notebooks shouldn’t be used as a project storage&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only you are heavily limited, as I mentioned above, but more importantly, you can’t have the same note save in two or more notebooks at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many years of using Evernote as a project management tool, it happen to me many times that I had to assign one note two three or even more projects, because sometimes, people just tend to send you overviews by emails and they don’t want to send the current progress of each project in separate email. No, they just send it in one email. Now, when you want to store this email in notebooks, which one will you choose? The most important project? The most recent project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you see how flawed this is. Yet Evernote still suggests that you use notebooks this way while completely ignoring their gold nugget, tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With tags, you don’t have to think about this too long. You can assign 100 tags per note. So if your that overview email mentions 5 projects, you can simply assign 5 tags to this note and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proper-naming-convention&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper naming convention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I suggest that we should switch from notebooks to tags, the most frequent argument is that with tags, everything would turn into a mess after some time. Yes, if the limit of 250 notebooks makes your Evernote less messy because you can’t simply create more notebooks, that’s fine. With 100.000 tags, you must get into a very messy situation, right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All it takes is a little bit of thinking and a little bit of discipline. With the right naming convention you can keep your list of tags organized even with almost a thousand of them, like in my case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed-img02.png&quot; alt=&quot;Keeping tags organized&quot; title=&quot;Keeping tags organized&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the image above, I have just six notebooks, everything else is managed by tags. Also, I have already almost 6.000 notes in my personal account and yet I am able to find anything almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I need to find that contract signed with that company. Hmm, let’s see. I can easily start searching among all my notes and with just two tags, I’m done: &lt;strong&gt;d.contract&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;k.AUTOCONT&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/why-the-concept-of-evernote-notebooks-is-flawed-img03.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search for anything, super fast!&quot; title=&quot;Search for anything, super fast!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tags representing &lt;em&gt;document type&lt;/em&gt; start with the &lt;strong&gt;d.&lt;/strong&gt; prefix. You can have d.contract, d.email_sent, d.email_received, d.offer, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tags representing &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;companies&lt;/em&gt; start with the &lt;strong&gt;k.&lt;/strong&gt; prefix. You can have k.Smith_John, k.MICROSOFT and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when you search for notes with tags assigned, you don’t have to think about the name of the tag, all you need is to know, that there should always be some &lt;em&gt;document type&lt;/em&gt;, some &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; and ideally even some _project_assigned to the note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you guessed it. All tags representing project start with the &lt;strong&gt;p.&lt;/strong&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-tasks-withevernote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing tasks with Evernote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make it really simple. You should be able to keep track of the progress of your tasks because buying a milk won’t always cut it. Some of the tasks I keep the track of takes more than a year to finish, so without a proper system, I would be completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you can use Evernote as a task manager. Compared to any other alternative, the tags are again the main reason why you shouldn’t consider anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task are basically notes with a reminder and due date assigned. This way, you can easily sort all your tasks by due date. Active tasks belong to &lt;strong&gt;t.active&lt;/strong&gt;notebook, idle tasks belong to &lt;strong&gt;t.idle&lt;/strong&gt; notebook and completed tasks, well, to &lt;strong&gt;t.completed&lt;/strong&gt; notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the so-called &lt;em&gt;Arrow Notation&lt;/em&gt;, you can keep track of everything that happens with the particular tasks. &lt;strong&gt;Smith_John -&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; means that Smith gave you some information or asked you to do something while &lt;strong&gt;-&amp;gt; Smith_John&lt;/strong&gt;means that you gave Smith some information or delegated some job to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you bump into somebody at work and by searching for &lt;strong&gt;-&amp;gt; Peter&lt;/strong&gt; you get immediately everything you need to discuss with this poor guy. That’s what I call power and that’s how I am able to manage all of my 129 currently active projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-not-a-coincidence-its-asystem&quot;&gt;It’s not a coincidence, it’s a system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is just a quick sneak peek of the methodology I have invented during my almost 10 years of using Evernote. I call it THE SYSTEM2, because all you need is two types of notebooks, two types of notes and two types of tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SYSTEM2 is a book and an online course. It’s based on GTD, but takes it to the next level. It’s Evernote on steroids and it’s available for free of charge for anyone who wants to get the most out of Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;
